const OneTimePadQuiz = () => {
  const questions = [
    {
      question: "What is the key characteristic of a One-Time Pad (OTP)?",
      options: [
        "Key is reused multiple times",
        "Key is truly random and used once",
        "Key is derived from plaintext",
        "Key is a fixed pattern"
      ],
      answer: "Key is truly random and used once",
      explanation: "The One-Time Pad key must be random, as long as the message, and used only once for perfect secrecy."
    },
    {
      question: "What type of cipher is the One-Time Pad considered?",
      options: [
        "Symmetric substitution cipher",
        "Asymmetric cipher",
        "Stream cipher",
        "Block cipher"
      ],
      answer: "Stream cipher",
      explanation: "OTP is a type of stream cipher encrypting one bit or character at a time."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is the One-Time Pad theoretically unbreakable?",
      options: [
        "Because the key is kept secret",
        "Because the key is random and as long as the message",
        "Because it uses complex math",
        "Because it uses multiple rounds"
      ],
      answer: "Because the key is random and as long as the message",
      explanation: "Perfect secrecy is achieved when the key is truly random, never reused, and at least as long as the message."
    },
    {
      question: "What operation is commonly used in One-Time Pad encryption?",
      options: [
        "Modular exponentiation",
        "Bitwise XOR",
        "Matrix multiplication",
        "Substitution"
      ],
      answer: "Bitwise XOR",
      explanation: "Encryption is done by XORing each bit/character of the plaintext with the corresponding key bit/character."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the One-Time Pad key is reused?",
      options: [
        "It becomes unbreakable",
        "Security is severely compromised",
        "Nothing changes",
        "The message is corrupted"
      ],
      answer: "Security is severely compromised",
      explanation: "Key reuse allows attackers to perform statistical analysis, eliminating the perfect secrecy property."
    },
    {
      question: "Claude Shannon proved that One-Time Pad offers:",
      options: [
        "Probabilistic security",
        "Perfect secrecy",
        "Computational security",
        "Partial security"
      ],
      answer: "Perfect secrecy",
      explanation: "Shannon proved mathematically that OTP provides perfect secrecy when implemented correctly."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a practical limitation of One-Time Pad?",
      options: [
        "It's too slow",
        "It's easily broken",
        "Key distribution and management",
        "It's too simple"
      ],
      answer: "Key distribution and management",
      explanation: "The requirement for secure key exchange and storage of keys as long as all messages is a major practical limitation."
    },
    {
      question: "If an OTP message is 10,000 bits long, how long must the key be?",
      options: [
        "100 bits",
        "1,000 bits",
        "At least 10,000 bits",
        "10,000 bits times 8"
      ],
      answer: "At least 10,000 bits",
      explanation: "The key must be at least as long as the message for theoretical security."
    },
    {
      question: "Which organization famously used One-Time Pads?",
      options: [
        "Amazon",
        "KGB and CIA during Cold War",
        "World Health Organization",
        "Internet Engineering Task Force"
      ],
      answer: "KGB and CIA during Cold War",
      explanation: "Intelligence agencies like the KGB and CIA used OTP for highly secure communications."
    },
    {
      question: "What form of One-Time Pad was used before computers?",
      options: [
        "Binary OTP",
        "Linguistic OTP",
        "Paper pads with random characters",
        "Quantum OTP"
      ],
      answer: "Paper pads with random characters",
      explanation: "Physical pads with randomly generated characters were used, giving the cipher its name."
